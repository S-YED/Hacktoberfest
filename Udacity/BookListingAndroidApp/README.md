## Project Overview
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app that allows a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. You will use the Google Books API to fetch results and display them to the user.

## Why This Project?
This project helps you learn about the web and how to get data from an API. You will also learn how to parse that data and display it to a user. This project is key for developing any app that makes use of a backend server, real-time data, or interactions over the internet.

## What Will I Learn?
This project combines various ideas and skills practiced throughout the course, including:
- Fetching data from an API
- Using an AsyncTask
- Parsing a JSON response
- Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user

## Requirements
To achieve this, we'll use the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started#intro). This is a well-maintained API that returns information in JSON format.
